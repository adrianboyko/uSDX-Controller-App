# uSDX-Controller-App

My uSDX Control system is made up of three parts:
* An app that runs on a Linux/Mac/Windows system (this repository).
* An Arduino-based board that replaces the LCD on the uSDX.
* Some minor, reversible modifications to the uSDX transceiver.

For information about the board and associated uSDX mods, see:
* [Firmware](https://github.com/adrianboyko/uSDX-Controller-Firmware)
* [Hardware](https://easyeda.com/AdrianBoyko/usdx-rc)

This project targets WB2CBA's v1.01 and v1.02 uSDX designs. For more information about this design and the uSDX in general, see:
* [WB2CBA's blog post announcing v1.02](https://antrak.org.tr/blog/projeler/usdx-an-arduino-based-sdr-all-mode-hf-transceiver-pcb-iteration-v1-02/)
